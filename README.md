# BART-OpenAPI-spec
An OpenAPI spec for the Bay Area Rapid Transit API, written to take away a lot of the pain of creating clients/wrappers for the API .

## Interactive API client/docs

Saving the entierty of the /docs directory and opening the index.html file contained within will provide you with a fully interactive client for experimenting with the BART API.

A partially functional deployment of the interactive documentation can be viewed [here](https://airikwarren.github.io/BART-OpenAPI-spec/). This deployment lacks the ability to send requests from within the documentation. I believe that this may be attributable to some sort of CORS protection provided by Github Pages but I unfortuntately do not have the time to properly investigate this. Saving the /docs directory and running a local instance of the deployment was however confirmed fully functional as of 05/10/2021.
